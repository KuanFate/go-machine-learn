# go-machine-learn


Machine learning repository based on Golang, because Python has GIL, is a dynamically-typed language, not easily
maintained by multiple people, and has poorer performance. Golang has native support for concurrency, is easy to
maintain, easy to get started with, and offers strong performance. I hope to provide a machine learning solution with
stronger performance while being user-friendly.

基于golang的机器学习仓库，因为python有GIL，动态语言，不易多人维护，性能较差；golang原生支持并发，易维护，上手容易，性能强，希望提供性能
更强的机器学习，同时易上手。

The "app" directory contains various implementations of machine learning algorithms. They can be executed through
corresponding test files or imported and run using the main function at the outermost directory level.

The "docs" directory includes algorithm implementation principles illustrated using mind maps.

app目录里是各种机器学习相关的算法实现,通过对应的test文件可以运行，也可以通过最外面层目录的main函数导入运行。

docs目录是用思维导图画的算法的实现原理
