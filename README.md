Machine learning repository based on Golang, because Python has GIL, is a dynamically-typed language, not easily
maintained by multiple people, and has poorer performance. Golang has native support for concurrency, is easy to
maintain, easy to get started with, and offers strong performance. I hope to provide a machine learning solution with
stronger performance while being user-friendly.

The "app" directory contains various implementations of machine learning algorithms
The "docs" directory includes algorithm implementation principles illustrated using mind maps.
